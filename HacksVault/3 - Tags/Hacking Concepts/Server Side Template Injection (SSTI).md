Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows untrusted input to be processed by a server-side template engine. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server, potentially allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, execute commands, or manipulate the applicationâ€™s behavior. Below is a detailed overview of SSTI, including how it works, common template engines affected, exploitation techniques, and mitigation strategies.

## Overview of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

### How SSTI Works

SSTI vulnerabilities arise when user input is directly incorporated into server-side templates without proper validation or sanitization. Template engines are designed to render dynamic content by combining templates with data. If an attacker can inject malicious code into the template, they can manipulate the server's behavior.

### Common Template Engines Affected

Several popular template engines are susceptible to SSTI vulnerabilities, including:

- **Jinja2**: Used in Python web frameworks like Flask.
- **Twig**: A template engine for PHP.
- **Django Templates**: The templating system used in Django applications.
- **Handlebars**: A JavaScript templating engine.
- **Mustache**: A logic-less template syntax.

### Exploitation Techniques

Attackers can exploit SSTI vulnerabilities using various techniques, including:

1. **Basic Injection**:
   - An attacker may input template syntax directly into a form field or URL parameter. For example, if a template engine evaluates user input, an attacker might input something like `{{ 7 * 7 }}` to execute a simple expression.

2. **Accessing Variables**:
   - Attackers can attempt to access server-side variables or objects. For example, in Jinja2, an attacker might try to access the `__class__` attribute of an object to gain information about the server environment.

3. **Executing Functions**:
   - If the template engine allows function calls, attackers can execute arbitrary functions. For example, in Jinja2, an attacker might use `{{ config.from_object('os') }}` to access the operating system's functions.

4. **Command Execution**:
   - In some cases, attackers can execute system commands. For example, using Jinja2, an attacker might inject `{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[40]('/bin/bash', 'r').read() }}` to execute a shell command.

5. **File Inclusion**:
   - Attackers may exploit SSTI to include files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information. For example, injecting `{{ config.from_object('open('/etc/passwd').read()') }}` could read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

### Example of SSTI

Consider a web application that uses Jinja2 for rendering templates and allows users to input their names:

```python
@app.route('/greet')
def greet():
    name = request.args.get('name')
    return render_template('greet.html', name=name)
```

If the `greet.html` template contains:

```html
Hello, {{ name }}!
```

An attacker could input `{{ config }}` in the `name` parameter, potentially exposing the configuration object of the application.

## Mitigation Strategies

To protect against SSTI vulnerabilities, organizations should implement the following strategies:

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Always validate and sanitize user input to ensure it does not contain malicious code or template syntax.
- **Use Safe Template Engines**: Choose template engines that provide built-in protections against code execution and do not allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Limit Template Functionality**: Configure template engines to disable or restrict access to sensitive functions and variables.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security assessments and code reviews to identify and remediate potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.

### Conclusion

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a serious vulnerability that can lead to significant security risks if not properly mitigated. Understanding how SSTI works, the common template engines affected, and the techniques used for exploitation is essential for developers and security professionals to protect their applications from potential attacks. By implementing robust security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of SSTI vulnerabilities and safeguard their systems and data.
