## Understanding Pivoting in Cybersecurity

**Pivoting** is a technique used in cybersecurity, particularly during penetration testing and ethical hacking, to gain access to additional systems or networks after an initial compromise. Once an attacker or tester has successfully infiltrated a system, they can use that access to explore and exploit other connected systems, effectively "pivoting" from one point to another within the network.

### Key Concepts of Pivoting

1. **Initial Compromise**: The process begins with gaining access to a target system, often through methods such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or using stolen credentials.

2. **Establishing a Foothold**: After compromising the initial system, the attacker establishes a foothold by installing backdoors, creating user accounts, or maintaining access through other means.

3. **Network Mapping**: The attacker maps the network to identify other systems, services, and potential targets. This can involve scanning for open ports, identifying running services, and gathering information about the network topology.

4. **Exploiting Trust Relationships**: Many networks have trust relationships between systems. For example, if a compromised system has access to a database server, the attacker can use that access to pivot to the database and extract sensitive information.

5. **Lateral Movement**: This refers to the process of moving from one compromised system to another within the same network. Attackers may use various techniques, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or leveraging tools like PsExec or WinRM.

### Techniques for Pivoting

1. **SSH Tunneling**: If the attacker has SSH access to a compromised system, they can create a tunnel to access other systems on the network securely.

2. **VPN Connections**: If the compromised system has a VPN connection to other networks, the attacker can use that connection to access additional resources.

3. **Proxying**: The attacker can set up a proxy on the compromised system, allowing them to route their traffic through it to access other systems without directly exposing their own IP address.

4. **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: If RDP is enabled on other systems, the attacker can use the compromised system to connect to those systems and gain access.

5. **Credential Harvesting**: By extracting credentials from the compromised system (e.g., using tools like Mimikatz), the attacker can gain access to other systems that the user has access to.

### Tools for Pivoting

Several tools can assist in the pivoting process:

- **Metasploit**: A popular penetration testing framework that includes modules for pivoting and lateral movement.
- **Cobalt Strike**: A commercial penetration testing tool that provides advanced capabilities for post-exploitation and pivoting.
- **ProxyChains**: A tool that allows users to redirect their network traffic through a series of proxies, facilitating pivoting.
- **SSH**: Secure Shell can be used for tunneling and creating secure connections to other systems.

### Conclusion

Pivoting is a critical technique in the arsenal of penetration testers and ethical hackers. By leveraging access to compromised systems, they can explore and exploit additional targets within a network, helping organizations identify vulnerabilities and improve their security posture. Understanding pivoting techniques and tools is essential for effective penetration testing and network security assessments. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before conducting any pivoting activities on a network.
