Create a BOT conversation with inputs.
```python
name = input("Hello! What's your name?: ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}!")

age_input = input("How old are you?: ")
age = int(age_input)
bot_age = 3
age_difference = (age - bot_age)
print(f"You are {age_difference} years older than me. I'm only {bot_age} years old!")

color = input("What's your favorite colour?: ")
print(f"Oh, {color} is a beautiful color")
```
