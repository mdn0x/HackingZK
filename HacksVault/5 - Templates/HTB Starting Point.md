# Objective

Learn how to start.
# CONNECT

To attack the target machine, you must be on the same network.  
Connect to the Starting Point VPN using one of the following options.

It may take a minute for HTB to recognize your connection.  
If you don't see an update after 2-3 minutes, refresh the page.

I will use OpenVPN, so i download the config file, go in the same directory and execute the following command :

```bash
┌──(mdn0x㉿mdn0xKali)-[~/HTB]
└─$ sudo openvpn starting_point_mdn0x.ovpn 
[sudo] password di mdn0x: 
```

We can start our [Vulnerable Machine](../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Vulnerable%20Machine.md).

Now we add the target IP to our /etc/hosts file, so we don't have to remember the [IP address](../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/IP%20address.md) every time :

```bash
┌──(mdn0x㉿mdn0xKali)-[~/HTB/Starting Point/Tier 0/Meow]
└─$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

We add a line with the given IP and a name .
