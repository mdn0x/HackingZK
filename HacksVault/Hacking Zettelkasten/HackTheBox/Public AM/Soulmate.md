## Rustscan - Nmap

First we add the target IP to our /etc/hosts file, then we use [Rustscan](../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Tools/Rustscan.md) that will pass the result to [Nmap](../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap.md) :

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(mdn0xã‰¿mdn0xKali)-[~/HTB/Machines/Soulmate]
â””â”€$ rustscan -a soulmate.htb -- -A 

Open 10.10.11.86:22

Max file size: 5MB. Formats: JPG, PNG, GIF maybe entry point.

Trying uploading `gif.php.` and similar obfuscations with new profile:

Not working cause they're just static files with sanitized names.

IDK why i broke this profile,made new profile, searching other vectors.

Spotted some sort of ESCAPED [Cross-site Scripting (XSS)](../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Cross-site%20Scripting%20(XSS).md):

Trying payloads, seems sanitized and always escaped so no vectors here.

Also spotted user [Enumeration](../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Enumeration.md) in registering:
