# CTF Writeups

## Hacking Zettelkasten

This repository contains personal writeups and notes from various Capture The Flag platforms and vulnerable machines. All solutions are written for educational purposes, can include sensitive content.

### Platforms
-TryHackMe (THM)\
-HackTheBox (HTB)\
-Personal Labs

## Other content
I created this Zettelkasten in Obsidian using [Wikilinks](Wikilinks.md) instead of tags, then pushed on Github appropriately changing links formatting, so navigating through the notes you can click on the links to be redirected to the other content and their relative explanation (the other content is located in the Tags folder):
- CVEs
- Hacking concepts
- Hacking tools
- Programming languages

I also pushed the other directories I created in the vault in case of necessity just to make it complete.

You can open the vault with Obsidian to also see the Graph Map created by the connections in the notes, then copy the format and make your own !!

## Note

This repo is still in progress so you may not find all content filled but i'm updating it almost every day. 

Thank you for reading.
