## Learning Outcomes

In the second tier, you'll delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity pen-testing, focusing on web exploitation techniques suitable for beginners. You'll discover the basics of [SQL Injection](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/SQL%20Injection.md), [Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection%20(SSTI).md), [Remote File Inclusion (RFI)](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Remote%20File%20Inclusion%20(RFI).md), and gain a grasp of how to use Web/[Reverse Shell](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Reverse%20Shell.md) effectively. Building on the knowledge from the first tier, you'll apply these techniques to exploit various services showcased earlier, ensuring a hands-on understanding of their vulnerabilities.

Additionally, you'll learn how to navigate [Jenkins](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Jenkins.md), a popular automation server, to log in and upload a [Groovy Shell Script](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Groovy%20Shell%20Script.md), a valuable skill for penetration testing. Finally, you'll round out your expertise by understanding how to upload files to an S3 Bucket, providing you with a comprehensive range of skills to excel in the cybersecurity field. This tier takes you one step further in your pen-testing journey.
