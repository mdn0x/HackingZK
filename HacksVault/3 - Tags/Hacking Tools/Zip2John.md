2. **Support for Multiple ZIP Formats**: The tool supports various ZIP file formats, including those created by different compression algorithms and encryption methods, making it versatile for different scenarios.

3. **Integration with John the Ripper**: Zip2John works seamlessly with John the Ripper, allowing users to leverage its powerful cracking capabilities to recover passwords from extracted hashes.

4. **Command-Line Interface**: The tool operates via a command-line interface, making it suitable for use in scripts and automated workflows, which is beneficial for security assessments.

5. **Open Source**: As part of the John the Ripper project, Zip2John is open-source, allowing users to modify and contribute to its development.
### Common Use Cases

- **Password Recovery**: Security professionals can use Zip2John to recover lost or forgotten passwords for ZIP files, especially in forensic investigations.

- **Penetration Testing**: During penetration tests, Zip2John can be employed to assess the strength of password protection on ZIP files, identifying weak passwords that could be exploited.

- **Security Audits**: Organizations can use the tool as part of security audits to evaluate the effectiveness of their password policies and the security of sensitive data stored in ZIP files.
### Example Command

To extract password hashes from a ZIP file, the following command can be used:
```
zip2john protected.zip > hashes.txt
```
This command will create a file named `hashes.txt` containing the extracted password hashes, which can then be processed by John the Ripper for cracking.

### Considerations
