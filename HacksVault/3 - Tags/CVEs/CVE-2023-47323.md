**NIST CVE Link:** https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47320  

## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The notification/messaging feature of Silverpeas Core 6.3.1 does not enforce access control on the ID parameter. This allows an attacker to read all messages sent between other users; including those sent only to administrators. 

### Usage/Exploitation
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can use a script or Burp Suite Intruder to view all messages by attacking the ID parameter in this URL: http://localhost:8080/silverpeas/RSILVERMAIL/jsp/ReadMessage.jsp?ID=[messageID] - the messages begin at "1" and increase in intervals of 1.
