## Overview of CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of documents written in markup languages like HTML and XML. It is essential for web development, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of web pages.

## Key Features of CSS

### Separation of Content and Presentation

- CSS enables the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), improving accessibility and maintainability.
- This separation allows multiple web pages to share a single CSS file, reducing redundancy.

### Syntax and Structure

- CSS consists of rules that include selectors and declaration blocks.

- A typical rule looks like this:

 `selector {     property: value; }`

### Types of CSS

- **Inline CSS**: Styles applied directly within HTML elements.
- **Embedded CSS**: Styles defined within a `<style>` tag in the HTML document.
- **External CSS**: Styles stored in separate `.css` files linked to HTML documents.

## CSS Modules and Versions

- CSS is continuously evolving, with the latest specifications being developed as separate modules rather than as a single version (like CSS3).
- Each module can have its own version number, allowing for more flexible updates.

## Importance in Web Development

- CSS is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
- It enhances user experience by allowing for responsive design, ensuring that web pages look good on various devices and screen sizes.

CSS is a powerful tool for web designers and developers, enabling them to create visually appealing and well-structured websites.
