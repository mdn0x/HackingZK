## Learning Outcomes

In the third tier, you will acquire advanced skills in cybersecurity pen-testing, extending your knowledge and capabilities. You'll start by mastering the art of exploiting vulnerabilities like XXE, [IDOR](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/IDOR.md), and Log4j, allowing you to uncover and leverage weaknesses in target systems. You'll also delve into the world of cookie manipulation, giving you the ability to manipulate and control user sessions, a crucial skill for ethical hacking.

As you progress, you'll learn about binary path hijacking and exploiting sudo permissions, enabling you to perform [Privilege Escalation](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Privilege%20Escalation.md) effectively. Understanding the basics of [Bruteforcing](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Concepts/Bruteforcing.md) will be a valuable tool in your pen-testing toolkit, helping you uncover weak passwords and gain unauthorized access.

Moreover, you'll explore how to exploit LXD for privileged filesystem access, and gain insights into exploiting insecure functions like "strcmp()" in [php](../../../../3%20-%20Tags/Programming%20Languages/php.md), which are frequently used in web applications. This comprehensive tier equips you with a broad range of advanced techniques and knowledge for a successful career in cybersecurity pen-testing.
