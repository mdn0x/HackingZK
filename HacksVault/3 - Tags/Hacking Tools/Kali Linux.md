```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

#### 2. Installing New Tools

You can install additional tools using the `apt` package manager. For example, to install `nmap`, use:

```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

#### 3. Accessing Tools

Most security tools in Kali Linux can be accessed from the Applications menu. You can also launch them from the terminal by typing their names (e.g., `nmap`, `metasploit`, etc.).

#### 4. Using the Terminal

Kali Linux is heavily command-line oriented. Familiarity with basic Linux commands (like `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, etc.) is essential for effective navigation and operation.
