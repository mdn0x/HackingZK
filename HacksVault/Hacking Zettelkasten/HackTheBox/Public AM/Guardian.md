## Rustscan - Nmap

First we add the target IP to our /etc/hosts file, then we use [Rustscan](../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Tools/Rustscan.md) that will pass the result to [Nmap](../../../3%20-%20Tags/Hacking%20Tools/Nmap.md) :

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(mdn0xã‰¿mdn0xKali)-[~/HTB/Machines/Guardian/user]
â””â”€$ rustscan -a guardian.htb -- -A
