The **Modula** [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") is a descendant of the [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_\(programming_language\) "Pascal (programming language)") language. It was developed in [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"), at [ETH Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich "ETH Zurich"), in the mid-1970s by [Niklaus Wirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth "Niklaus Wirth"), the same person who designed Pascal. The main innovation of Modula over Pascal is a [module system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming "Modular programming"), used for grouping sets of related declarations into program units; hence the name _Modula_. The language is defined in a report by Wirth called _Modula. A language for modular multiprogramming_ published 1976.[1](1.md)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula#cite_note-1)

Modula was first implemented by Wirth on a [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11 "PDP-11"). Very soon, other implementations followed, most importantly, the [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") developed for [University of York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_York "University of York") Modula, and one at [Philips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips "Philips") Laboratories named PL Modula, which generated code for the [LSI-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSI-11 "LSI-11") [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor").

The development of Modula was discontinued soon after its publication. Wirth then concentrated his efforts on Modula's successor, [Modula-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2 "Modula-2").
